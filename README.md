# aeriui

_aeriui_ is a modern, accessible, and highly customizable React UI Library built with Typescript and TailwindCSS.

to get started, configure your project by running:
```
npx aeriui@latest init
```
answer the required questions, and once the initialization has finished, you are free to add any aeriui component. 

add a component to your project by running:
``` 
npx aeriui@latest add <component>
```
this will add the component to a /src/app/components/ui directory, allowing you to freely edit, update, and import the component across your project. 
a list of avaiable components, as well as documentation, is available at [our website](https://aeriui.vercel.app).
